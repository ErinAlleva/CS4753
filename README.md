Union is a platform for students to connect with other students to do tasks that they either don't have time or don't know how to do.

What we offer students differs in that we give them a way to get trustworthy help from people within their community by only allowing those with a university email address to be members. Students can register to offer services and then other students can decide to pay for those services. In addition to the reliability of the members being fellow students, our service has a high level of convenience due to all members being located in the same area. 

This service lowers the amount of time spent on simple tasks so you can spend more time on creative projects, homework, studying, and more. It also serves as an easy way to connect students to other students with more specific skills. It is also an easy way to make money in a familiar environment for students that wish to offer services.
